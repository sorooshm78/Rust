# Installation
If youâ€™re a Windows Subsystem for Linux user run the following in your terminal, then follow the on-screen instructions to install Rust.
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Configuring the PATH environment variable
In the Rust development environment, all tools are installed to the ~/.cargo/bin directory, and this is where you will find the Rust toolchain, including rustc, cargo, and rustup.

Accordingly, it is customary for Rust developers to include this directory in their PATH environment variable. During installation rustup will attempt to configure the PATH. Because of differences between platforms, command shells, and bugs in rustup, the modifications to PATH may not take effect until the console is restarted, or the user is logged out, or it may not succeed at all.

If, after installation, running rustc --version in the console fails, this is the most likely reason.
